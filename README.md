MotorWare Configuration Files
=============================

This repository contains the global configuration files that are used by all
our MotorWare projects.  It mainly contains the motor and board parameters that
are specific to the hardware that is used.

When changing configuration for a new hardware setup, please create a new
branch with a meaningful name (something like "leg_prototype_1").  Do *not* use
the master branch.

This way it is always clear which configuration is currently used and danger of
messing up with other projects is reduced.


About the files
---------------

Single motor applications use the files `user.h`, `user_j1.h` and `user_j5.h`.
The first one configures the microcontroller and decides which of the two
motors is used by the application.  The other two contain the motor specific
configuration for J1 and J5 respectively.

Dual motor applications use the files `user1.h`, `user2.h`, `user_mtr_on_j1.h`
and `user_mtr_on_j5.h`.  The first two correspond to the `user.h` of the single
motor case (I don't now why there are two files as most of the configuration is
redundant and probably only the values of `user1.h` are actually used...).  The
last two contain the configurations for J1 and J5.

Note: In `user_mtr_on_j5.h` the names of all defines have to be suffixed with
`_2`!
